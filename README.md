# Project Lance

Project Lance is a full, locally-run emulation of Pokémon link battles from Generation I. It will also support [Pokémon Showdown's](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown) Generation I Ubers, OU, UU, NU, NFE, LC, and Randoms formats.

The goal of this project is to create a reliable Pokémon battling simulator, that can interface with both humans and computers, which can be used to train AI battling agents.
